Converting Solidworks Drawings to a 3D Printed Part
1. Check the scale of the solidworks drawing, make sure the scale and the units are compatible with the specific 3D printer you are planning on using 

2. Save the solidworks model in STL format. 

3. Export your model as an STL. Choose suitable units and resolution for your 3D printer 

4. Import STL file into a slicing software such as Ultimaker Cura 

5. Adjust settings such as infill density, print speed, support structures 

6. Preview sliced model, make sure it looks correct 

7. Slice the model, which converts model into G-code (instructions for the 3D printer) 

8. Transfer G-code into 3D printer using a USB stick 

9. Pre-heat 3D printer 

10. Load filament into 3D printer 

11. Initiate the print job 

12. Remove support structures and smooth rough surfaces on the final product after it has finished printing
