# Optical-Components
Welcome to the GitHub repository for Open Source Optical Components developed by six engineering students from Durham University. Here we share our open source designs and resources for various optical components aimed at undercutting the market for developing countries. 
# About Us
We are a group of passionate students from Durham University's Engineering Department. 
Our team comprises individuals with diverse backgrounds and expertise, coming together to explore and develop open-source solutions in the field of optics.
# Project Overview
Our project focuses on designing and developing optical components that are essential for various applications. We aim to facilitate research and education by providing them a library with cheap and innovative componenets.
# What We Offer
In this repository you will find:
1.  Designs for optical components: breadboards, lens holders, lens tubes and               more advanced components such as rotational and translational mounts.
2.  Manufacturing Instructions: Guidelines and recommendations for manufacturing            optical components using different techniques and materials.
# How to Contribute
We welcome contributions from the community to further enhance and expand this repository. We encourage contributing by:
1.  Providing feedback about the existing componenets.
2.  Suggest more componenets to design and develop.
3.  Suggest changes about the repository.
