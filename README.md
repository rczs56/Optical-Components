# Optical-Components
Welcome to the Open Source Optical Components repository!


The primary objective of this project is to design and develop open-source optical components tailored specifically for the needs of developing countries. These componenets are either manual or robotic.
This project is a collaborative effort initiated and developed by a team of six university students.
